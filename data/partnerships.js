    description: `DiscussMed partnered with a fertility doctor in the New York area to discuss the controversial topic of abortion. In the wake of recent events, the right for women to have an abortion is being limited in many states across the U.S. Therefore, we at DiscussMed believe that it is important to have a sit-down interview with a fertility doctor to discuss what an abortion is, why the right to have one is important, and how we as advocates can get invovled and champion the right to choice.`,
