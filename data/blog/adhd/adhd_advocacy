ADHD advocacy is extremely important to:

-   Spread awareness about ADHD in order to create a more inclusive society. Surveys have shown that nearly 40% of people with ADHD have been excluded in school thus showing the lack of resources for and awareness of those suffering from ADHD. Additionally, people with ADHD often have trouble in social circumstances– to learn more about this, refer to the ADHD podcast with Dr. Spinks-Franklin in the podcast section of the discussmed.org website. People with ADHD struggle socially and they are often targeted due to their impulsivity and hyperactivity. Therefore, advocacy is essential to increase awareness for those with ADHD.
    
-   Increase research funding for ADHD treatments. Firstly, many young children with ADHD take medications and treatments, so it is important that there is funding to conduct research and clinical trials about the efficacy of such treatments. Additionally, there is no cure for ADHD and the causes and risk factors are still unknown, so by increasing funding for ADHD research, hopefully the risk factors can be identified and a cure developed.
    

How can you advocate:

There are many opportunities to get involved in advocacy. Charities such as [CHADD](https://chadd.org/policy-positions/), Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and [ADDA](https://add.org/category/non-member/adhd-awareness-advocacy-non-member/), Attention Deficit Disorder Association, have many resources, articles, and opportunities for advocacy. To learn more about CHADD, specifically, go to the resources section of the discussmed.org website. By advocating to raise awareness, increase research funding, and help those suffering from ADHD, you will make a difference and create a better society for tomorrow.
