Arthritis is a very general term describing the inflammation of one’s joints. Arthritis being a very general term means there are many different types of arthritis. Some common types of arthritis includes:

-   **Rheumatoid arthritis:** Most common inflammatory arthritis often involving multiple joints of the hands and feet. It occurs when the lining of the joints or tendons is inflamed. Those with this disease need to take proper action to ensure it does damage the heart, lungs, and eyes.
    
-   **Osteoarthritis:** One of the most common forms of arthritis. It is caused by the gradual wearing down of tissues around bones.
    
-   **Gout:** Excess uric acid levels causes this acid to crystallize in joints and lead to a greater likelihood of kidney stones
    

Arthritis is due to inflammation which is when the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. Inflammation is generally a positive reaction as it protects oneself from foreign threats such as bacteria and viruses; however, when the body’s inflammatory response continues even after the foreign threats are gone, inflammation is dangerous.

The exact cause of this improper inflammatory response leading to arthritis is unknown, but there are a multitude of possible causes. Some causes are expected to be the result of genes and inherited traits. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, the most common gene related risk factor is that of the HLA genes. The HLA genes produce proteins which help the body distinguish between its own proteins and that of foreign sources. Therefore, when there are mutations in the HLA genes, it can cause the body to be unable to distinguish between the two sources of proteins and attack its own proteins. When the immune system attacks its own proteins, it results in an autoimmune disease and inflammation which are the causes and roots of rheumatoid arthritis. While some causes may be that of genes, there are certainly other causes and risk factors. For rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to the genetic factors, infections or exposure to dust can also lead to the development of the disease.
