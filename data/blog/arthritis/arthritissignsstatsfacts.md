There are many different types of arthritis with each carrying its own unique symptoms. However, there are some general symptoms to be aware of:

-   Pain
    
-   Stiffness
    
-   Decreased range of motion
    
-   Muscle weakness
    
-   Swelling
    

Arthritis is quite unique in that there are many different forms of it. More specifically, there are more than 100 different types of arthritis with over 50 million adults affected by it in the United States alone. In other words, over 22% of adults in the United States have arthritis. While anyone can have arthritis, it is most commonly found in older Americans with nearly 50% of those over 60 having the disease and the prevalence further increasing with age. It is also most common in women with around 26% having it compared to 19% for men. The reasons for the increased percent of women with the disease is unknown. While arthritis is already extremely prevalent, its presence is expected to only increase with a projected 79 million adults in the U.S. having the disease by 2040.

For most forms of arthritis, there is no current cure, only treatments that will help alleviate the effects. A cure is essential as arthritis is usually chronic either lasting for many years or being lifelong meaning it greatly affects the lives of those with it. Arthritis can also greatly alter the length one lives in more severe cases. For example, severe arthritis has been shown to shorten one’s life by six to seven years. It is interesting to note that the first diagnosis of arthritis was actually rather recent with the first recording of it occurring in 1800.
