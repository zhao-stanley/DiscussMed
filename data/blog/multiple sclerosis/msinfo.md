The symptoms that those with MS experience vary widely. Some people have extremely severe symptoms and signs while others have relatively mild experiences. Some of the more common symptoms and signs include:

-   Fatigue
    
-   Loss of balance
    
-   Dizziness
    
-   A tremor
    
-   Pain in the back of the eyes
    

Nearly 1 million people in the United States currently have multiple sclerosis. With that, approximately 200 cases are diagnosed every week. Of those diagnosed, a whopping 76% are female. Additionally, most people diagnosed are between the ages of 20 and 50 and live in colder climates. Those diagnosed have an approximately 5 to 10 year decrease in life expectancy.

The most common type of MS is relapse-remitting MS. This type of MS results in most patients feeling fine for long periods of time, and then occasionally, they have relapses which occur when the symptoms reappear. The second most common type of MS is secondary-progressive MS. This type occurs after relapse-remitting MS when the relapses become more sparring, but the damage has progressed making one’s condition and symptoms worsen.
