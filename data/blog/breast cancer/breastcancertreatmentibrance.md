Before breast cancer spreads beyond the area in which it formed, there are surgeries and treatments which could shrink, slow, or even remove the tumor, but once the breast cancer becomes metastatic, meaning it has spread beyond the breast tissue, then there is no cure and only treatments which can attempt to shrink or slow tumor growth. However, there have been recent advancements in treatments to metastatic breast cancer. For example, in March of 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of palbociclib which is sold under the name Ibrance.

Ibrance is a type of hormone therapy. Hormone therapies are treatments which aim to add, remove, or block hormones (regulatory substances inside the body). Ibrance specifically works to inhibit cell growth for cancerous and healthy cells in the region thus slowing the spread and progression of the cancer; however, since it can affect surrounding cells, there are some serious side effects possible such as anemia. Ibrance slows cell growth by targeting and regulating cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 which are enzymes that regulate the cell cycle and cell division.

Ibrance and medications of the like are groundbreaking due to their focus on advanced breast cancers which are notoriously hard to treat and combat. It is also notable in its use as a hormone therapy which has been found to be more effective than other therapies and can decrease the risk of certain accompanying health conditions such as heart disease and dementia.
