**Summary:**  Open angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. It occurs when the trabecular meshwork is not draining properly causing pressure in the eye to increase which damages the optic nerve eventually leading to blindness. This study attempts to halt the progression of open-angle glaucoma using an argon laser trabeculoplasty which creates a pathway to allow the drainage of the trabecular meshwork to reduce the pressure buildup in the eye. This study found that the use of this treatment was successful as only 45% of patients saw their glaucoma’s progress while 62% of those not receiving the treatment saw their glaucoma’s progress.

**Implications:**  Argon laser trabeculoplasty treatment can not undo the damage done to the optic nerve by the open-angle glaucoma, but it can help in halting the progression of the glaucoma and prevent any further damage of the optic nerve.
