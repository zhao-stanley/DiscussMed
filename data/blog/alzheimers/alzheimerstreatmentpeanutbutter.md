Unlike other blogs about treatments and medications about each disease, this blog will focus on a more obscure fact about diagnosing Alzheimer’s: the ability to use peanut butter. Researchers have found that the use of peanut butter and a ruler can help determine if someone has early stage Alzheimer’s disease. Diagnosing Alzheimer’s early and before many symptoms appear, helps lessen one’s anxiety about the symptoms they will face and allows one’s friends and family to maximize their time with them.

The use of a smell test to identify if one has Alzheimer’s is because Alzheimer’s uniquely results in the left nostril being much more impaired than the right nostril with the left nostril not detecting a smell until it is on average 10 centimeters closer than the right nostril. Therefore, by using a ruler and peanut butter, researchers can test the maximum distance between each of a person's nostrils and peanut butter that enables them to smell the peanut butter. If the differences in distance between the right nostril is around 10 centimeters longer than the left nostril, then the test may suggest that a person has Alzheimer's disease.

**Note: The title says "Alzheimers" due to markdown requirements, but the proper syntax is "Alzheimer's"**
