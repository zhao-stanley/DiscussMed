**Summary:**  Alzheimer’s harms the brain by breaking down acetylcholine (chemical messenger that allows for communication in the brain), so cholinesterase inhibitors counter this by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine boosting the amount available to the brain. This study focused on two cholinesterase inhibitors: Donepezil and Rivastigmine. Those who took the Donepezil saw a 4.1% decrease in the progression of Alzheimer’s. Very few people saw the adverse effects of the drug with only 17% of people experiencing nausea and diarrhea which were the two most common side effects. Those who took Rivastigmine saw a 5.4% decrease in the progression of Alzheimer’s. Nausea was the most common side effect with 35% of those who took the drug experiencing it. 

There are also drugs used to slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s. One drug is Alpha-tocopherol which delayed the progression of the disease for six months but did not improve one’s condition. The most common adverse effect was falling with 14% of people experiencing it. Another drug was Selegiline which delayed the progression of the disease for four months but did not improve one’s condition. The most common adverse effect was syncope which 10% of people taking the drug experienced. 

Treatments also focus on treating the behavioral effects of Alzheimer’s. To treat depression, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are used (increase the amount of serotonin in the brain which allows for more communication between neurons). Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are also used to treat depression (increase the amount of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain causing more communication between neurons). Drugs also focused on treating psychosis with neuroleptics showing success (alters the effect of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine to change one’s behavior). 

Preventative measures are also under way and include estrogen-replacement therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a vaccine directed at amyloid production.
